It wasn't enough that every major plot point was framed with the main character triumphing over angry bumbling fools because she took two seconds to think and clam her mind, but then every person she interacted with found it necessary to summarize the moral lesson for you by way of saying how wrong they were to underestimate her and her approach and just how darned great she is.<br/><br/>(As a side note, I think the debates from other reviewers on sexism is a case of Poe's Law. Yes, there's plenty of over the top misogyny. But it's mostly there to demonstrate just how vile the various straw characters are. It would be like an author using the kick-the-dog trope literally, then for reviewers to get enmeshed in a debate on animal abuse.)<br/><br/>Even so, it was an action packed adventure that I found myself engrossed by despite myself. The characters were distinctive and likable, the fight scenes vivid, and the tone oddly lighthearted in spite of the seemingly grim context. Between the absurd proselytizing and the military theme which isn't my usual thing, I kept thinking I'd stop reading it any minute. Instead I got so caught up in the ride that I was done before I knew it.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

So, not your typical vampire story.<br/><br/>I loved Tana as a protagonist because she is neither a damsel in distress, nor an action hero, but a survivor. Almost every moment of the story she is nearly paralyzed with fear, yet in spite of that she is determined and clever. She doesn't romanticize monsters and conveniently forget the dark pasts of cute bad boys. Instead she's compassionate in a way that feels like she sees people and monsters in all their complexity, neither forgiving foibles for virtues nor dismissing all redeeming qualities in the face of transgression. Being able to really see people for who they are is key to her survival, but it also makes her kind. Plus she's sardonic with a self-deprecating inner dialog, which, y'know, I'm into. <br/><br/>I will say, I was a bit put off of the book at first. I got a bit of a Black Mirror vibe what with its vampire hunter reality TV shows and social media celebrity fang-bangers, and I only like that sort of black social commentary in small doses. But it turned out to be a moderately employed and well executed part of a much bigger picture.<br/><br/>I've been binging Holly Black's books lately and I've come to love her writing style, in this book in particular. Her quotes at the beginning of each chapter are beautiful and often eerily fitting.  The world feels tangible and the characters real and flawed and full of personality. There are so many moments that surprised me and made me smile--a great word choice, a hauntingly lyrical quote, a witty piece of dialog, a plot twist I didn't see coming. <br/><br/>Much more to this book than I would have expected, and much more of it that I liked.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It shows off Martin's talent for artfully crafting language, character development, vibrant imagery, and masterful storytelling.<br/><br/>But it also drove me crazy, and I didn't find myself as drawn in as I was with the other books in the series--as is evidenced by the fact that it took me six months to get through it.<br/><br/>If I were to identify the theme of this book, it might be something like <spoiler>""Our heroes of the Seven Kingdoms grow up and become burdened with the responsibilities of management.""  While this is perhaps an interesting and oft unexplored area of fantasy, I just couldn't get into it.  <br/><br/>The ending of this book was terribly unsatisfying, all the more so for coming after the incomplete volume four.  This is particularly maddening in contrast to the first three books of the series--one of the things that I most admired about those books is their strong independent story arc and thesis that ended so conclusively.  Although they were part of a larger series, they each felt like complete and satisfying works that could stand alone.  It is mystifying how the last two novels devolved so far into cliff-hangers and seemingly arbitrary endings.<br/><br/></spoiler><br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed most of the chapters as independent short stories.  But as a part of the Song of Ice and Fire series I found it sub-par and exasperating. ",,,2,,,0,,,,,

She also goes into some pretty intense personal stories about her own experience with these kinds of issues. <br/><br/>I admire her for going through that journey and sharing her experience with others. At the same time, I think it might make mindfulness practices seem unapproachable. For example, she ends the book with a story about how when she was started she was told ""this is going to destroy your life."" She goes on to say that ""the key is to stick it out until the reconstruction can begin."" That's not a great sales pitch for mindfulness, and I suspect not necessarily applicable to people who are not dealing with major trauma.<br/><br/>When there was advice that was more general and might apply to my situation, I found it pretty unapproachable. For example, she often suggests that the solution to an issue is to love yourself unconditionally or to realize that you are ""perfect just the way you are"". That's a pretty tall order without any additional information on how to get there. <br/><br/>Finally, I suspect that there may be a style issue. The people that she often quoted as mentors were usually from the more woo woo side of the meditation world. <br/><br/>This might be a good resource for some, but it just didn't gel for me.<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But it seems that the research for this book was mostly collected through interviews of volunteers. If I was predisposed to think that polyamory is harmful to relationships and families, I would be skeptical of evidence to the contrary gathered from a self-selected, self-reporting group of advocates. But I guess you've gotta start somewhere.<br/><br/>With that caveat, this was a worthwhile read, albeit dry. (As I suppose one would expect from an academically oriented book.) <br/><br/>A lot of the content would be unsurprising to anyone with poly experience, such as the sections on the challenges that poly people face (jealousy, unicorn hunters, couple's privilege, etc) and the techniques for dealing with them (communication, honesty, agreements, etc). There were a few sections that framed issues differently than I'd thought of them before--for example, distinguishing between people who identify as poly versus people who ""do"" poly.<br/><br/>The quantitive aspect was interesting. While not terribly surprising, I was disappointed to learn how prevalent what I think of as outdated and unhealthy models of polyamory are practiced. For example, Sheff says that the majority of the people that she interviewed practice some form of hierarchy. (I do wish she had distinguished with a bit more nuance there--between descriptive versus proscriptive hierarchy and hierarchy versus priorities. But that is probably more of a statement on the state of poly nomenclature than it is on her research.)<br/><br/>I learned the most in the chapters dealing with poly families--that is to say, poly people with children. I had already done a fair bit of research on the subject from other sources and had previously learned that the primary challenges tend to be from social stigma--friends, parents of friends, other family members, the children themselves, and in extreme cases, loss of custody. The commonly mentioned up-sides include having more loving and supportive adults around and exposure to good communication skills.<br/><br/>Sheffs research included all of those, but also mentioned a number of other aspects that I hadn't heard about before. For example, children wishing for more space and privacy in larger joined poly households, the difficulty of merging complex poly households, challenges surrounding financial dependency and legal guardianship, and how to approach the close relationships that have formed between children and partners after a breakup. Most of these new-to-me issues came up in cohabiting configurations and (as Sheff points out) many of them are not unique to polyamory. <br/><br/>As a side note, I disliked the narration on the audio version of the book. Most of the book was read in a monotone that was almost robotic. But when reading quotes from the study participants, the narrator would switch into accents including a Texan man's drawl, the giggle of a young girl, and an African  American woman's emphatic attitude. And yes, it's just as cringe-worthy as you're imagining.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But I already know that sociopaths exist and I'd been hoping for a more in-depth study of the topic. In that, this book was a disappointment. <br/><br/>From what I can tell, the majority of the author's education on the topic of sociopaths comes from counseling the people who have been traumatized by them.  While this may serve as excellent fodder for cautionary tales, it gives a decidedly skewed perspective on the topic.

Zeynep compares modern activism to historical civil rights movements, interspersed with riveting accounts from her personal experiences within these communities.<br/><br/>While that would have been a fascinating and engaging account on its own, in the course laying the foundation for that narrow topic, the scope of the areas covered becomes an anthropological study of technology on social behavior that is both highly relevant to trajectory of current political and social events and deeply meaningful to me personally. <br/><br/>Throughout her work, Zeynup often points out the effect that technology has on human behaviors well understood by sociologists such as collective effervescence (in which individuals get swept up in a social movement) and homophily (the tendency of people to be drawn to people like themselves) and goes on to explain how those behaviors are amplified or modified by various technologies. <br/><br/>She discusses in great detail the effect that ad driven revenue has had on the algorithms in various social media platforms on cultural awareness and attitudes, as well as the tremendous power that these platforms wield. <br/><br/>She does an in-depth review of various platforms and examines how the choice and enforcement of specific policies such as identity and reputation can have certain emergent effects, both positive and negative. A real-name policy, for example, may make it easy for governments to identify and target political dissidents; while at the same time making it more difficult to anonymously harass persecuted minorities. <br/><br/>She does an analysis of the approaches that various governments have taken to navigate and control information with technology to retain power. For example, China's well known ""great firewall"" of selective censorship, focuses not on criticism, but rather any call to organize and mobilize. Turkey and Russia on the other hand have taken a different tactic--strategic campaigns to delegitimize social media as a source of news, in part by employing large groups to flood social media with posts intended to distract and spread doubt. <br/><br/>Well written, insightful, balanced, and smart--I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in activism, human behavior, technology, politics, or any combination of the above.

So, when he hears that a friend, one of the most powerful people in the empire, has been unjustly charged with a crime for which the penalty is death, he returns to the heart of the empire to help.  Through a combination of determination, audacity, and nothing to lose, he can accomplish things that all of his powerful friends can't.<br/><br/>I find the stories from this time in Vlad's life sad.  He gets beat up a lot, and can't do much about it.  He faces powers much greater than himself, and he loses a lot.  When he prevails, it is not a hero's victory where all of his problems are fortuitously resolved by coincidence.  Nor is it the hero martyr--where he struggles on to fight the good fight, sacrificing his own happiness because it's the Right Thing.

The now familiar theme in which Vlad puts himself into harms way for the sake of someone he cares about, and who would much rather he stay out of their business, unfolds in the typical fashion.  <br/><br/>The delightful writing experiment that adds an element of flavor to the story is that each segment begins with an interlude of Vlad's experiencing one of the courses of his favorite meal.  I have never read a foodie's joy, satisfaction, and contentment expressed so well.  And woven into the descriptions are subtle philosophical points, foreshadowing, introspection and a sprinkling of wit.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a typical swashbuckling adventure story, you'll probably be put off by the foodie bits.

Instead, her research focuses on women and spends a great deal of time on the social and cultural shame triggers. While these insights may be valuable for many women, it seems I'm in a very different demographic than the women who she interviewed. Expectations steaming from places like fashion magazines, societal pressure to have children and subsequently be a good parent, and the pressure to being a good wife and Christian just aren't my deal.<br/><br/>There were a few valuable nuggets in here.

Like other works of fiction fitting that description, the storytelling is secondary to the propaganda, and so judged as a story it falls somewhere between decent and mediocre.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, it is judged by its ability to emotionally connect the reader to the views being expressed, it ranks among the best of its kind, putting it alongside Atlas Shrugged, 1984, and Market Forces(*).  It fabricates a near-future society in which a set of commonly held current day values are taken to their logical extreme.  The depiction is both believable and horrific, challenging worldview assumptions that readers may normally take for granted.<br/><br/>Even as just a story, I found it compelling.  If nothing else, it has the novelty of being a scifi story being told from the perspective of a middle-aged woman.  The characters were well developed and changed over the course of the novel, the plot was well paced, and it had a solid ending.  There are tedious and slow bits, and at times it felt contrived and predictable.  But overall I found myself looking forward to returning to it everyday.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(*) Market Forces stands out among these as a truly superb story, even when separated from its message.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After reading some other reviews, I found myself wanting to explore the social themes represented in the book.  <br/><br/><spoiler><br/><br/>At its core, The Unit speaks to how society values people.  Now, it's worth noting here that the society in question is, I believe, Sweeden.  So, this was a bit puzzling at times as an American reader.<br/><br/>In the story, ""dispensable"" people are rounded up in middle-age, and brought to live together in a community.  On one hand, this community is a picturesque facility, providing all of the luxury, social connections, and creative fodder for the ideal retirement.  This is in stark juxtaposition to the purpose of their admittance to The Unit--to serve as guinea pigs in medical experiments and organ donors to better serve the population of ""needed"" individuals.<br/><br/>At the heart of the story is the slow unfolding of what personalities and lifestyle choices result in an individual ending up as dispensable.  People with children are needed, because additional humans contribute to the economic success of the ""community"".  Likewise, gainfully employees individuals are economically valuable.  People who have a romantic partner who are willing to register their love officially also become needed, though this somewhat breaks the economic pattern otherwise established.<br/><br/>This leaves independent, introverted, creative, and academic types being the most likely to end up as dispensable.  They are less likely to hold down a steady job, let alone achieve career success, favoring instead to focus on their writing or music or art.  They are the oddballs and value solitude and therefore have trouble finding a partner.<br/><br/>The cruel irony is that when this group of people is finally brought together after a lifetime of struggle and loneliness, they are suddenly among a group of people that can understand one another.  They forge friendships, thrive creatively, find happiness, discover love.  <br/><br/>But the lifespan of a individual in The Unit is short--a six year tenure is not unheard of, but quite rare.  Moreover, this long sought-after life fulfillment is soured by the maladies inflicted on them as side effects of medical experiments, and the slow harvesting of their bodies.  Half-deafness from a donated ear bone; boils from one drug treatment; madness from another.  <br/><br/>While the members of The Unit express bitterness, rage and rebellion against the institution that put them here, at the same time they accurately represent a population that, at its core, holds the same values.  This is demonstrated through their meek submission in being brought to The Unit, their cooperation in participating in the experiments, and their acquiesce in giving their fatal ""final donation"" of a major organ.  Most of all, it is demonstrated by the ending of the book, in which Dorrit chooses not to flee and try to survive with her unexpected child, but instead gives it up and makes her final donation.  <br/><br/>One could interpret these behaviors as stemming from perceived or actual helplessness to fight the system.  However, I saw it as something more than that--in spite of their anger and defiant attitude, deep down they believed in the tenants of the society to which they belong: that they are dispensable, and that their purpose is to serve the greater good of The Community.  This was a bold move by the author, showing the power that our deepest rooted value systems have on us, in spite of intellectual positions to the contrary.<br/><br/>In a second theme that runs in parallel, the community, in its pursuit of gender equality has criminalized anything hinting at differentiated gender roles.  It starts with measures that some would find innocuous--legislated requirements that both parents share equally in both work and care of children.  Then it follows that there should be no gender differentiation of work in the home--women must change their own tires, and men must do their own cooking.  Finally, it becomes illegal for males to take a dominant role in courtship or in the bedroom.<br/><br/>This leaves a segment of the population for whom they have a dark secret--a taboo and illicit fetish for traditional hetero-normative gender roles.<br/><br/>I found this last theme fascinating as it is close to an area of some agitation for me--namely, the lack of distinction for many between gender equality and gender differentiation.<br/><br/></spoiler><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There were two main elements that set Ghostwritten apart for me.<br/><br/>First was the subtle and often minor threads connecting the stories to one another.  Even though the stories were most often completely unrelated to one another, this device evoked an entirely different effect.  Rather than feeling as though with each new story I was starting over, instead it felt as though some new part of the same world was opening up to me.<br/><br/>Ok, so that's probably just my weird thing.  <br/><br/>The far more compelling theme across all of the stories was the ability of the author to put you inside the head of his characters.  Each story is narrated the first-person perspective of its protagonist, not an uncommon device to be sure.  But usually the term seems to extend to their experiences, what they see, the conversations they have, the thoughts that go through their head.  <br/><br/>Mitchell takes the notion of first-person perspective to a whole new level.  You are so far into the worldview, belief-system, and self-image of the narrating character that you may come to the end of a story before realizing that they are quite mad.  The experience of having a reality that you have, albeit only temporarily constructed, crumble beneath you is powerful and not entirely comfortable.  <br/><br/>Of course, not all of the stories fuck with your head to that extreme.  But for each you must struggle to discern the reality of the world through the imperfect perspective of the main character, not unlike from your own imperfect perception in this world.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

As someone who has varying degrees of familiarity with just about every piece of technology or micro-culture presented in the book, I found it endlessly entertaining.  It's like when you hear a song from an obscure band that you like featured in a pop-culture movie or tee vee show.  There's a moment of almost giddy delight at seeing something you felt is yours alone put in the spotlight for the world to see what is so great about it.  For geeks, hackers, gamers, hipsters and San Franciscians, it's that feeling a hundred times over.<br/><br/>And for anyone with libertarian values who is more than a little on edge about the direction of anti-terrorism policies in the US, the future it paints is deeply unsettling.  In particular, the setting of real technologies, places and cultures from my life made the story all too plausible.  I made the mistake of listening to the bit of this book where it goes from the normal life of a seventeen year old kid in San Francisco to an Orwellian horror story while waiting in line to get my photo taken at the DMV.  I wouldn't normally describe the DMV as creepy, but that day it sure was.<br/><br/>All of that being said, I don't think that this book has the timeless artistic quality of a masterpiece.

I was driving along the bay bridge when my wandering mind was jerked back to the graphic and deeply disturbing scene that was playing.  I spent the remainder of my ride home cringing, flinching, and occasionally emitting small noises of shock and distress.  When I got home, I immediately looked up the book on amazon to determine if it was fiction or non--if it was fiction, I figured, there was no reason to subject myself to such an upsetting story.<br/><br/>One of the reviews on amazon changed my mind.  It acknowledged the graphic and unpleasant nature of the beginning of the book, but swore up and down it would be worth it, and pleaded with readers to stick with it.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>It is a beautifully written, highly allegorical novel with vivid images--sometimes beautiful and emotional, sometimes graphic and violent.  There are themes of tragic romance, of religion and mysticism, of a passionate and driven madwoman, of a shockingly unsympathetic burn victim in a hospital bed.  There are frequent divergences, like a cynical and bitter version of Bill Bryson, to delve into the science or history behind some small detail relevant to the story.<br/><br/>It's noteworthy that this is clearly written for a pop audience.  Some readers used to popular novels may find it a challenge to keep up with the frequent changes in perspective.  While some readers used to complex scifi or dense fantasy might find it somewhat simplistic.

But hear me out.<br/><br/>The world that is painted by this work so well personifies the ideals of a certain kind of person.  It is weaved to be attractive and deeply gratifying to a person who sees the world that way, while making no attempt whatever to work through the real challenges of understanding the other side.  Indeed, they make no apologies for their one-sidedness.  Their point is to make you understand their side, and they have no interest in mucking around with anything else.<br/><br/>Well, it was attractive and gratifying to me.  But throughout I felt a little bit like I was gorging myself on candy--soaking up the things I wanted to hear, but knowing on some level that it was not the whole story.

Dauntless brought my attention to a lot of the reasons for this. The character development, while often spending a lot of time laying out motivations for the actions of the individual, the characters themselves tend to feel flat and hard to believe. It often feels like someone who doesn't really get people, knowing characters are supposed to have motivations, and groping around for some hamfisted attempt at emotional depth. <br/><br/>Space battles themselves aren't that appealing to me, unless the story has sufficiently drawn me into the reasons for the fight. Yes, yes. 'Splosions and lasers and, space physics and tech, oh my! But you know they're just gonna shoot at each other for awhile, then whoever is most well suited to win at that particular point in the plotline will win, suffering exactly the appropriate degree of loss appropriate for the scene in question. So, unless I have some reason to care about the people involved or why the hell they are doing it in the first place, watching that formula play out yet becomes tedious.<br/><br/>And that brings me to perhaps the most core complaint. Perhaps due to my own personal values, a story in which actions are governed by authority and rank and ""there's a war on!"" is hard for me to connect to. I just find myself asking over and over again--why is all this happening? why are you idiots so blindly accepting of it? and why should I care?<br/><br/>But this book in particular? OH MY GOD SO BORING. Yes, it is very cool that the time delay sending signals between ships far apart enough to be measured in light-units has complex effects on the dynamics of space battles. But is it /really/ necessary to explain the nature of the effect every. single. time. it comes up? <br/><br/>(dramatic reenactment:)<br/><br/>""He was frustrated because, due to the distance of the ship, his message wouldn't be received for an hour. THEN it would take another hour for him to receive the response.""<br/><br/>""He was sitting on the edge of his seat, waiting with baited breath as he watched the displays. Even though he knew that what he was seeing had actually taken place three and a half hours ago. Because receiving the feed from the sensors took s long time because it was far away.""<br/><br/>""He wondered what the enemy would be thinking between the last message he sent, and when the would be able to see the evidence of damage he had done to their fleet in the half hour that it would take for the visual image to be received to transmit the messages over the vast distances involved.""<br/><br/>YES I GET IT. Battles in space are not realtime. This could be interesting, except instead, it's not.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The characters are more complex, and the humor, while there, is much less goofy and over the top.  His writing in this book is also a huge step up from the MHI series.

It's also hard to say if the cringe-worthy one-liners (""How do you like that motherfucker!"", ""Let's do this!"", and ""That was frickin awesome!"" to cite just a few examples,) was intended to be representative of the lovable big dumb lug of a main character, or just plain bad writing.<br/><br/>In spite of all of that, it was a fun little action story with big guns and monsters.

It is well written, and the harsh world it paints is vivid and gets under your skin.  <br/><br/>But I'm left asking... why?  We see a slice of a young girl's awful life.

So imagine my excitement when I discovered that the show is based off a series of novels, and that these in turn are based on the experiences of the author, a real world forensic anthropologist named Kathy Reich.  My beloved Bones (her nickname on the show) is a real person!<br/><br/>To my dismay, the character of Temperance Brennan of the novel little resembles the character of Bones on television.  Where Bones is overly literal and likely to approach social situations with an anthropological, analytical frankness that often makes people uncomfortable, Temperance cracks cheezy jokes with her detective buddies and worries about career politics.  Where Bones is independent, has difficulty connecting with her emotions, and is afraid of children and family, Temperance has a full grown daughter and gets ""a tingle in her nether regions"" from the sight of her partner.  Where Bones has nerves of steel when it comes to dealing with the unpleasant aspects of her trade, Temperance complains about disgusting smells and bugs.  Temperance of the novel is, in short, boring.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the novel didn't have much to recommend it.  This isn't my typical genre, so I don't feel I can judge it fairly.  But the writing came across as amateurish, and the events of the novel seemed to be trying too hard to make an impact.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The particulars of your circumstance seem inexorable, the few obvious choices before you the only ones in the whole world.  If that life doesn't happen to appeal to you, what is left but despair?  <br/><br/>What it may be impossible to understand without the perspective that comes from doing some living is that, in fact, you have more freedom, opportunity, and maneuverability than you'll likely ever have again.<br/><br/>I realize that these are not the things the book is known for.

While it is all of these things, it is first and foremost a book about the love of stories and the art of story telling.<br/><br/>By far the most compelling aspect of this novel is the artistry with which the words are woven together.  While reading this book--an effort that took me all of three days, drawn in the wee hours of the morning--I found myself rereading the previous paragraph or sentence, for the simple pleasure of their beauty.  There are passages that imprinted themselves so strongly in my mind that I recall their position on the page, the shape of the surrounding text.<br/><br/>Few novels have left me with such a vivid mental image of its world and characters.  I could draw a picture of the layout of the house, I could tell you how Dr. Maudsley carries himself when he speaks.<br/><br/>I'll admit, it is not without flaws.  A couple of the major themes of the book, namely the unbearable separation of twins, which were leaned on heavily without ever having established a solid foundation--or any reason for the reader to be interested.  The story was a bit sprawling, diminishing the power of some of the main plot lines by stretching the readers focus too thin.  And to my great surprise, the ending rather fizzled out.  However, I am willing to forgive these shortcomings as the mistakes of a debut novelist, made up for in so many other ways.<br/><br/>I am already looking forward to rereading this book.  Watching the story be unfold again ""every event identical, in every detail the same--yet entirely, profoundly different"" in the new light of mysteries revealed.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

She also lists gives us a peek into the academic community around Buffy in particular, including a scholarly conference.  <br/><br/>I enjoyed the chapter on Symbol and Language--these being two elements that I find most defining about the show.  I appreciate more the distinct difference in style of speech between the teenagers, adults, and vampires respectively.  The symbolism discussed in this chapter pertains to the direct metaphors that the show is known for, wherein the supernatural is used to portray an exaggerated depiction of teenage experience.<br/><br/>Beyond that though, the meaning that the author infers from Buffy seemed a stretch to say the least.  Buffy was the tea leaves being read, and the divination was constructed out of the academic repertoire.  Everything was phallic symbols, sexuality, religious overtones, and gender identity.

While most of the concepts by themselves are hardly ground-breaking revolutions, the down-to-earth presentation applied to a specific and hazardous activity makes the material much more tangible. <br/><br/>Some of the tenants include:<br/><br/>* Use mindfulness and cognitive behavioral techniques to identify when defensive mechanisms to protect your ego are getting in the way of an accurate assessment of the situation, the risk, and your own abilities--let alone your ability to have fun.<br/><br/>* Adopt a growth mindset that values learning over an individual achievement.<br/><br/>* Arm yourself with knowledge of the situation (the climb) and assessment of the risks.  Before you act, each possible outcome of any risk should be clear so that you can be prepared to fully commit to both.<br/><br/>* When you act, fully and mindfully engage.<br/><br/>* Embrace the moments of chaos that are outside of your comfort zone--that is where all the good stuff happens.<br/><br/>* Adopt a mindset and internal dialog that provides options, rather than one that limits you.  Speak to yourself in ways that orient you towards positive action (""Stay in balance"" vs. ""Don't fall"") and use questions rather than statements (""How can I make this fall safer?"" instead of ""This fall is too dangerous."")<br/><br/>* When you act, get out of the cognitive space and operate from your body and your instinct.  Trust your preparation, your training, your intuition--stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>* Train yourself to adopt a state of relaxed alertness.<br/><br/>See, most of that doesn't sounds all that exciting boiled down into simple statements like that.  But when described in the context of how it applies when you're hanging off a cliff by your fingernails, it packs a bigger punch.  And I must say, there are many times that my internal excuse for not applying these bits of wisdom that I already know boils down to--""sure that's all well and good, but THIS is just too hard to apply that to"".  That excuse looks pretty flimsy when held up in this light.<br/><br/>The writing style is amateurish and goofy, with lots of made-up lingo to describe ideas for which there are well established schools of thought.  Normally this would be a pretty big hit for me, but in this case it works in spite of it. <br/><br/>I'll close a set of my favorite highlights from the book: <br/><br/>""Don't worry.  Be actively concerned.  Better yet, be curious.""<br/>""A warrior isn't careful; he is observant and he pays attention.""",,,1,,,0,,,,,

What I got was, firstly a heavy handed review of the sociological and cultural explanations for gender differences in society, and second a condescending and clearly biased review of the scientific evidence for biological/brain gender differences as an explanation for cultural gender differences.<br/><br/>I did learn some interesting things.  One study showed a clear gender prejudice in hiring for engineering roles.  Identical resumes were sent to companies with only a change in the name being obviously female versus obviously male, and the male resumes had a higher response rate.  <br/><br/>A theme throughout the book was the relationship of self-identification and social grouping--basically the influence that feeling that ""people like me"" has on our self-image, and in turn our actions, behavior, aptitude.  A simple example is the study in which female college students were asked if they were interested in pursuing engineering studies, but in differing environments.  One environment featured a classic geek decor, while the other featured a more preppy decor.  The female students were about equal to the male students in positively responding to the idea of studying engineering in the preppy lab, while response rate dropped when asked surrounded by D&D and candy wrappers.  (This seems much broader than a gender issue to me, but it's a gender book, so ok.)<br/><br/>When it came to the potential non-social influences though... bias and condescension, oh my!  (I think the narration made this particularly cringe-worthy--the sneer when describing a competing theory, or the pompus and self-important voice used when quoting an opponent were particularly off-putting.)  In a study showing evidence in favor of biological explanations for gender differences in behavior, the author would (rightly) lambaste the study for using self-reports valid evidence.  Then pages later, in a study intended to offer an alternate explanation would be a phrase like, ""Mothers of infants report...""  <br/><br/>Peppered throughout the book, most often on opening chapters, were arguments that amounted to:<br/><br/><pre>""Here's an obviously incorrect or invalid argument that would horrify modern readers with current data."" --some sexist dude from 100 years ago<br/><br/>""Here's a current hypothesis regarding gender differences that deserves further study."" --some modern scientist<br/><br/>See how they're the same!  Obviously the modern scientist is wrong because their hypothesis bears some surface similarities to someone from a different time who held beliefs we know to be untrue!</pre><br/><br/>While I did learn that there was little or no valid evidence for some of the biological gender differences that I had previously heard touted, it was hardly a review of what differences are known to exist.  This was most obvious when the author mentioned in passing that one known gender difference--smaller brains of females versus males--results in extensive structural differences in the brain.  And that this most likely served to make the genders more similar, as the different structures achieved different things in the same way.<br/><br/>Such a key piece of data and the huge assertion must be backed by chapters of exposition of the evidence and detailed critique of the studies backing it--in short, the same treatment given to any other hypothesis in the book, right?  In a book about how gender based brain differences may impact gender behaviors, surely the fact that there is allegedly structural brain differences will be examined in detail.

I've grown wary of this device though, as it seems to lead either to dramatizing the petty industry politics of the time, or to long winding passages of personal details before returning to the dry and dense material.  <br/><br/>Not so with Quantum.  The upbringings, personal beliefs, and politics of the great figures involved in the development of quantum mechanics all weave into the story of their motivations, biases and passions.  What drove each man to dedicate himself to untangling the mysteries of nature played a key role in the evolution of quantum theory, as did their personal struggles to come to grips with evidence that challenged their most deeply held beliefs. <br/><br/>But don't get the impression that this very human story is skimpy on the science.  While I still would not presume to speak intelligently on quantum theory, this book did a lot to bring the concepts involved into closer to the realm of the graspable.<br/><br/><br/>This book brought to us by the goodreads Science and Inquiry Book Club, selection for April 1-30, 2014.",,"Science and Inquiry Book Club: April 1, 2014 - April 30, 2014",1,,,0,,,,,

His talk focused on the physiological changes that the brain goes through during this stage of life, and how this contributes to the behavior often seen in teenagers.  He also put a great deal of emphasis on debunking common misconceptions about the what's and why's of adolescence.  I was excited to read about the nuts and bolts of what was covered in the short session. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, that was not to be.  What I had perceived as the primary topic of the book--the changes in the brain during adolescence--was certainly a foundation.  But it was covered in fairly shallow terms, after which he delved into a confounding range of topics.  This wide scope seemed to represent a set of personal philosophies and approaches to navigating the numerous challenges that adolescence are likely to encounter.  Towards the end, he goes even further afield, cramming in a grab-bag of general life-lessons like ""make sure to get enough sleep"" and ""don't litter"". <br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong--I can (theoretically) get behind just about all of the techniques that he advocates and the reasons backing them up.  The chapters on attachment theory and understanding how they effect your relationships were particularly enlightening as an adult, and his approach to discussing sexuality, drug use, and moving back home were well informed and respectful.  I would likely recommend this book to anyone raising an adolescent as a solid perspective backed by a lot of data and wisdom.  But be aware that there is plenty of bias.<br/><br/>As to his goal of writing this such that an adolescent would also want to read it and find it appealing... well, I don't know.  But I can't imagine I would have during those years.  His self-admitted use of acronyms had me groaning by the end, and his invented terminology for mindfulness and meditation concepts such as ""time in"" would have seemed awfully silly to me as a teen or young adult.  But what do I know?  Maybe it reads better to modern youth. <br/><br/>In summary: Lots of great content! I just wish it was more focused and deep. And who knows how it is for parents or teens.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

On one hand the over-30, ""there ain't no such thing as a free lunch"" camp is suspicious of anything labeled ""free"".

Having been a part of a few groups that I would describe as ""tribes,"" and having a sense of what the defining characteristics are, some of they dynamics, and what they have to offer, I have been interested in a book that dissected this topic further for some time.<br/><br/>This is not that book.  While it does center around the topic of tribes, and does touch on some dissection of them, it is more accurate to describe this book as social commentary on the romantic lives of people in their 20's and 30's today and how tribes are related to that, than it is about tribes themselves.  In particular, there is a big focus on the path towards marriage, and how tribes may provide a familial function in the intermediary time between starting life and getting married.  <br/><br/>There's some interesting stuff here.  For example, while I had been aware that fewer and fewer people of my generation were choosing marriage, but reading about it in more detail was interesting.  It even touches on evolutionary psychology, which is a topic that I am interested in.  But the content through the often embarrassing lens of a bumbling single guy flailing around trying to justify why he hasn't met Mrs. Right.  I imagine this might be of more interest to people that find the prospect of ending up on the other side of a white picket fence more appealing, but even to the extent that this is true, I feel like he didn't do the topic justice.  <spoiler>This impression was brought into sharp relief when Watters warps up the final chapter from his honeymoon suite.</spoiler><br/><br/>Disappointing.

The premise of the book is that the scientific view is not the bleak and cold perspective that it has a reputation for.  In support of this, the book is chock full of little tidbits that demonstrate the beauty, the elegance, the chaos and the awe-inspiring complexity of the world around us.  Dawkins endeavors to make science real to us, to seduce us with its simplicity, to floor us by making the massive tangible, and to tantalize us with the beautiful intricacy that can be seen if you just have the understanding.<br/><br/>Sadly I can also describe this book as a long and rambling rant about the bountiful and varied thorns in Richard Dawkins' side.  Sure, I share the pain of many of those thorns.  But even to me, his litany of complaints eventually started to feel like the mean-spirited nit-picking of a cantankerous old man.<br/><br/>It is tricky to strike a balance between providing harsh criticism of bad ideas while still being respectful to the people who believe them.  And yet this is a challenge that skeptics should be uniquely well suited for.  I never cease to be amazed when a skeptic work explains the natural human fallacies that tend to lead to a particular faulty conclusion and the mechanism in our brains that make the belief appealing and intuitive...  then in the next paragraph, have the audacity to call people who have made these entirely reasonable mistakes idiots or charlatans!<br/><br/>Excepting perhaps the small choir of skeptics that Dawkins is preaching to, we all know someone who holds a scientifically unsound belief.  Even most generally pro-science people hold one or two personal superstitions.  Nobody appreciates their friends and family members mocked or accused of malicious intent, and they take it even less kindly when the name-calling is pointed their way.  It is a tragic irony that this is what leaves people with a bad taste in their mouth, leading to the very anti-science sentiments that Dawkins is trying to prevent.<br/><br/>I wish I could recommend this book to friends.  I would love to be able to say, ""Read this, and maybe you will begin to see why being an atheist is not depressing as you are imagining, but in fact wondrous and hopeful.""  But I would be ashamed for a friend to read this book, and be subjected to witnessing the cruel ridicule dished out by Dawkins.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I suppose it isn't shocking that a book on the topic of language and cognition would touch on a broad array of topics.  Still, the variety of studies and disciplines that were referenced to support the thesis of the book kept it fresh and interesting from beginning to end.<br/><br/>My only minor complaint is that the author has a tendency to get into meta talk mode for excessive chunks of time.  First he'll tell you what he's going to be talking about, then he'll explain why you really should care, and after having talked about it, he'll take a few pages to make sure you got it.  Drove me crazy at first, but once I got into the flow it was easy to skim past.<br/><br/>Overall a great read for those of us who are endlessly fascinated by words, semantics and cognition.<br/>",,,1,logophiles,,0,,,,,

It is almost exactly like the Hitchhikers Guide series, except instead of a hapless British man finding himself in improbable adventures on space ships and distant worlds, it is a hapless British man--Adams himself--finding himself in improbable adventures while he travels the earth seeking out endangered species.<br/><br/>He greets these adventures with the same bemused but amiable bewilderment found in his other works, but it is belied by his fierce and unrelenting wit and perceptiveness.  He casually tosses out poignant insights with the tone of cheerful pessimism that I love so well.  Against the hilarity of his writing is an odd juxtaposition of the grim and brutal picture he is painting of the world.  It's hilarious, it's sad, but most of all it's beautiful.  <br/><br/>If you like Adam's other works, don't miss out on this one.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable.  More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others.  This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.<br/><br/>The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another.  That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions.  One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.<br/><br/>So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others.  That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.<br/><br/>One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom.  I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Learning of the schools and towns that the Cadbury family founded was fascinating.

The picture she paints of the greedy and malicious Craft representative that orchestrated the merge is suspect.

Perhaps because of hearing so many people rave about it, I had high hopes. But where I had hoped for a deeper understanding of introversions, this book was in essence one long tirade of, ""No really, it's okay to be introverted! And being extroverted isn't all that.""<br/><br/>Even the definition of introverts in this book was muddled. It conflated the idea of introverts with those who are shy, sensitive, and contemplative. While she readily admits that she is using a broader ""definition"" of the word introvert to refer to her desired group of characteristics, I find this generalization harmful. It is common for people to mistake introversion for any number of commonly associated traits, and leads to no end of misattribution grief for everyone involved. <br/><br/>If you're seeking validation for being a quiet flavor of different, this book will probably be very satisfying. If you're looking for a factual and well researched analysis of introverts, keep walking.

In the audio however, he made the unfortunate choice to interleave this commentary throughout the reading.  As a result, the main content of the book is interrupted every few minutes by a defensive exposition directed at the critics of the original version, an expression of regret at a poor choice of words, or an update on the political drama in the scientific community around controversial points of minutia. <br/><br/>The ""endnote"" commentary is helpfully signified by a change in narration to Dawkins himself.  So at first I tried fast-forwarding through these bits.  But the interruptions (every 2-5 minutes, often lasting longer than the actual content) proved too frequent for that approach.  Also, when I found myself grinding my teeth at the sound of Dawkin's voice, I figured it was a good signal that it was time to give it up.<br/><br/>It's a shame.

The professor is especially enamored with this particular sentence structure, and with the ability for sentences of this nature to take the reader on a journey, a journey that he believes to be more compelling and expressive than the oft touted simple and direct writing style advocated by Strunk & White.<br/><br/>This has been the most successful of my (admittedly half-hearted) attempts to learn about grammar and sentence construction.  I think this is because of the professors apparent allergy to describing grammar in terms of rules, believing this to take the life and joy out of the craft of writing.  Instead, he focuses on giving ample examples of various forms of sentence construction, and emphasizing the importance of learning to tune your ears to understand the proper rhythm of correct grammar. <br/><br/>On the down side, I think this course could have been about a third shorter without losing much of the substance.  A lot of that space was taken up by railing against conventional writing wisdom, of which I was mostly unfamiliar, and at least some of which I suspect is known only to professionals.  <br/><br/>Overall a great course, as long as you have a fair bit of patience.

The story of the crime itself served as a thread that leads you through the investigative methods of the time, the culture, and the reporting.

So when a corpse turned up without a head this presented a considerable problem in identification and later, conviction.  <br/><br/>Later when the case was in trial, at one point women were banned from the court room due to necessity of discussing anatomical details of the victim deemed inappropriate for ladies.<br/><br/>Particularly interesting were the ""tabloid wars"" between Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal.  The respective papers competed for readers attention by employing sensationalism, then a drastic departure from contemporary journalism.  The papers played an active role in the development of the case from the beginning.  The highly publicized nature of the murder forced the police department's hand in investigating it when they would have otherwise dropped it; the journalists investigation throughout turned up clues and witnesses that became key evidence in the prosecution; and the reporting was followed closely by the suspects, frequently influencing their actions.<br/><br/>A fun peek into life and death in the Gilded Age.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

(What he refers to as ""the deferred life plan"".)  Instead, it advocates designing the lifestyle that you would find personally fulfilling, then deliberately executing a plan to live that life now.  <br/><br/>Ferriss goes on to give guidance on how to accomplish this based on his own experience and the feedback that he has received from readers since the first edition of the book was published.  Some key concepts include going on an ""information diet"" to discover how little you miss all of the information that eats up your time and mindspace; cutting out all activities and relationships that bring you stress and unhappiness; hiring virtual assistants to take care of all of the minutiae to free yourself to do the things you want; guidance on starting a business that can run itself for the purpose of bringing in income while consuming a minimum amount of your time; living and working abroad to increase the value of your money; and finally, how to get past the depression and existential crisis that will hit if you succeed.  <br/><br/>The downside of this book is that the author is a bit off-putting.  He seems to get a thrill from getting one over on people, in a way that feels like it lacks integrity.  He doesn't seem to care about his efforts bringing value to the world, but is happy to cheat or churn out crap for his personal gain.  He comes off at times as shallow, selfish and arrogant.<br/><br/>I'd rate this book a 3.5.  If you can get past the periodic sketchyness of the author, the content is quite good, both in the value system that it proposes (aforementioned complaints aside) and the pragmatic application.  On a personal note, I picked this up because it seemed relevant to someone staring at a fork in life's road.  For that purpose, it was exceedingly suitable. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The premise of the book is summed up well in this passage from one of the appendages:  ""A central argument for this book is that for the past three decades, the influence of social and cognitive factors on gender traits has been systematically overestimated while the innate factors have been neglected.""<br/><br/>This is a difficult subject to tackle without coming across as a sexist and a bigot.  But I was consistently impressed with Sax's ability to approach these topics delicately but unambiguously.  His careful phrasing effectively disarmed the knee-jerk defensive reaction, and unapologetically delivered his points in the most reasonable tone.<br/><br/>The writing was pleasant to read, and the content thought-provoking, enlightening and challenging.<br/><br/><b>The Bad</b><br/><br/>Sax mixes in a lot of his personal views on morality and proper child rearing.  There are whole pages which hardly reference gender at all, which instead serve as a soapbox for Sax to rant about the need for discipline or rail against mushy liberal parenting approaches.<br/><br/>I have little basis on which to judge his parenting advice, being a topic I have little knowledge of or interest in.  Even so, it came off as prudish and overbearing, and I think the book suffered for it.<br/><br/><b>The Unforgivable</b><br/><br/>In the chapter six, titled ""Sex"", a sensationalist and thoroughly debunked myth, ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_party_(sexuality)"">Rainbow Parties</a>"" is cited as evidence for the moral decline of our society and the outrageous activities that kids these days engage in.  This glaring factual error lends serious doubt to the credibility of the author as an unbiased man of evidence.<br/><br/><b>In Summary</b><br/><br/>The book begins with the claim that this book is the only one of its kind.  The very idea of innate gender differences is too taboo to be discussed by any except those promoting antiquated and inaccurate gender stereotypes.  Why Gender Matters is valuable to the extent that this is true.

Others like the ""flywheel and the doom loop,"" describing the difference between building momentum on successful results rather than fostering disappointment through hype without substance, were illuminating and thought provoking. <br/><br/>That being said, I have two big beefs with the book.  First and foremost is the claim that these ideas represent science.  While I'm not a trained researcher, I know a falsifiable claim when I see it--""the hedgehog concept"" ain't it.  This would have just been mildly irksome, but it was made worse by the author insisting on the scientific validity of his findings frequently and at great length.<br/><br/>Second is the reading style of the author in the audiobook.  I am fairly sure that the author changed the content for the recording, using techniques such as repetition, pausing for effect, and a stern and emphatic tone of voice to drive his points home.

It is light reading that can open your eyes to a different perspective on how psychoactive chemicals fit into the world.  But be warned--it has an agenda, which is laid on pretty heavily.

That being said, it does give clear, easy to understand explanations of some of some of the fundamental economic concepts that are difficult to wrap one's head around, and I think these principles are presented fairly.  Beyond that, you should expect an easy to read presentation of the Austrian Economics view.

I would love to be able to say that it is packed full of information, and that such an expansive work has given me a new perspective on the relationship of mind altering chemicals with our culture, even our species.<br/><br/>And while I am tempted to say those things, I am afraid that the strongest thing I took away from this book was that I cannot trust it.<br/><br/>It was fairly early in the book that I started to get the nagging feeling that many of the stories had a sensationalist, anecdotal twinge.  However, given the frequent references to studies, many of which were undertaken by the author himself, I withheld judgment.  But it was not long though before the book ventured into territory I am familiar with and my nagging suspicions were confirmed.  Many of the accounts seemed anomalous examples at best, and in many cases flat out false.<br/><br/>What I consider even more damning is the subjects that were not covered.  The many ways that psychoactive states have been beneficial--medicinal use, for example was barely touched upon.  Worse, the myriad real risks from drug use--not as glamorous as stabbing your party guest on a dose of PCP.  Siegel is no better than those spreading uninformed rumors, or the drug propaganda he criticizes.  By focusing on the edge cases, he leaves readers unprepared for the real risks that face them.<br/><br/>This is all the more saddening because there is such a dense and diverse supply of information in this book.  From amusing and fascinating tales of drug use in the animal kingdom; to tales of drug use by the mentally unstable; to a history of drug use by our presidents.  I only find it disheartening that I cannot trust the validity of any of the so called facts in this book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
